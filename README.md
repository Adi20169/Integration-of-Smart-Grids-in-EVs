# Integration-of-Smart-Grids-in-EVs
With the threat of global warming, many countries have been working towards achieving a low carbon emission footprint and increasing their use of renewable energy sources. This has caused a rise in the need for electric vehicles (EVs) which in turn has brought challenges to the power grid construction with the main issue being demand for power. It is argued that the use of smart grids could reduce the load on power facilities and allow for the complete switch to renewable energy sources. To ensure the most efficient microgrid interconnection, active customer participation in electricity markets is necessary. In addition, to meet demand, there may be a time where landowners may have to generate energy using technologies and in return, energy companies would pay installation costs or reduce the cost of their own electrical use. Smart grids also allow for better storage of power generated by renewable energy sources and a communication server between the user and the power system.
